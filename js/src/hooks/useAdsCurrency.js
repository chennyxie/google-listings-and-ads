/**
 * Get the store's currency object, eventually extended with the Ads' currency and symbol.
 * This would allow using store's formatting preferences,
 * with an actual currency that's being used by Google Ads Account.
 *
 * We start with a "currency-less" config, as the store's preferences are relatively fast to obtain.
 * So, we could start serving meaningful content to the user, while they wait for Ads details to be fetched.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * ```js
 * const { currency, isResolving } = useAdsCurrency()
 * console.log( currency.formatAmount( 1234.678 ) ) // Print the number in the store's currency format '1 234,68'.
 * // After some time, once Ads account details are fetched.
 * console.log( currency.hasFinishedResolution ) // true
 * console.log( currency.formatAmount( 1234.678 ) ) // Print the number in the store's currency format with the Ad's currency '1 234,68 zÅ‚'.
 * ```
 *
 * @see CurrencyFactory
 *
 * @return {{currency: Object, hasFinishedResolution: boolean | undefined}} The currency object.
